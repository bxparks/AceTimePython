# Changelog

* Unreleased
    * `zone_processor.py`
        * Correctly attached the UTC offsets of `start_date_time` of a
          `MatchingEra` to the previous `MatchingEra`.
        * Improve detection of an exact match between a `Transition` and the
          start time of its `MatchingEra`.
            * Previously, the `start_date_time` would be compared to only one
              of the 'w', 's' or 'u' versions of the `transition_time`,
              depending on the `modifier` of the `start_date_time`.
            * Now, the `start_date_time` is converted into all 3 units (using
              the last transition of the previous `MatchingEra`). If any of
              them match the corresponding `transition_time_{w,s,u}` times,
              the Transition is considered to an exact match to the start of the
              `MatchingEra`.
            * Resolves all validation errors between Python `acetime.acetz`
              class and the Hinnant `date` library.
* (2021-09-08)
    * Initial split from
      [AceTimeTools](https://github.com/bxparks/AceTimeTools).
